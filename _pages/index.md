### Motivation

_Building on our ongoing reflections on a historical “transmedia” approach[1], this international conference—organized by the [Impresso project](https://impresso-project.ch/) and the History Department of the University of Lausanne—aims to move beyond the traditional understanding of press-radio relations. As the two main information media in the 20th century, their relationship has often been reduced in literature to one of simple institutional competition. This conference seeks to investigate the complexity of their relations. It aims to throw light on mutual influences over content and format, staff and practices circulation between the two media, as well as cross-representations and cross-uses. A central objective is to explore the novel research perspectives offered by the development of digital tools in the context of the digitization of press and radio archives. This initiative follows on from the conference "[Transmedia History: Circulations, Reconfigurations and New Methodologies](https://impresso.github.io/transmedia/)", held in Lausanne in January 2025, whose Book of Abstracts is available online: [10.5281/zenodo.15052470](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15052470). A special issue of TMG Journal of Media History, entitled “Transmedia Histories,” is also in preparation._

Although recent years have seen proposals for more integrated approaches (transmedia, cross-media, media convergence, etc.), mass media historiography has long been constructed around compartmentalized views of each media. This is particularly true for press studies, where radio is rarely mentioned or only very sporadically (Delporte et al., 2016; Hampton, 2004; Koss, 1990). On the other hand, radio has been more often studied in relation to other media. This has been the case with television (TV), most notably in research on public broadcasting (Jeanneney, 1999; Drack, 2000; Mäusli and Steigmeier, 2006; Mäusli, Steigmeier, and Vallotton, 2011), but also with the press, due to the its far-reaching influence during the early days of radio broadcasting (Arceneaux, 2019). Instances of studies on the relations of the press and radio primarily pertained to their rivalry. In the 1920s, the emergence of radio, capable of reaching audiences more rapidly, sparked concern among newspaper publishers. They attempted to curb its development, notably by claiming a monopoly on news gathering and imposing advertising restrictions to protect their commercial position. Some alternatively sought to oversee its development or even became station owners themselves (Stamm, 2010). This rivalry led to numerous institutional negotiations over time, such as during the liberalization of audiovisual broadcasting (Sandoz, 2025, 153-188). It persists to this day, most notably in recent debates around digital content production by public radio and TV broadcasting companies.

These central and significant tensions have dominated historiography, overshadowing those other forms of interaction between the press and radio which remain largely underexplored. The press and radio differ profoundly in terms of medium (written vs. oral), technological constraints, modes and means of production/distribution, and archiving conditions—which pose specific challenges for preservation, access, and joint analysis. Nonetheless, these two media have always evolved within what Siân Nicholas calls a "culture of intermediality" (2012). This culture manifests through stylistic convergence, content interdependence (notably mutual borrowing), as well as staff circulation. Such a perspective invites us to envision "an integrated history of mass media," focusing on interactions and co-evolutions between media throughout their development (Nicholas, 2012, 383).

The conference wishes to explore this "interlinked media history" (Nicholas, 2012, 383), the roots of which even predate the massification of radio (Arceneaux, 2014). We encourage research on complex interactions and interdependencies between the press and radio, so as to move past analyses of sole competition dynamics. The goal is to shed light on transmedia dynamics, mobilizing tools and approaches (e.g., digital methods) that can, more broadly, enrich theoretical and methodological reflections on media history. Our aim is to contribute to a de-compartmentalized and “entangled” history of the press and radio, understanding their development within a broader social, political, and cultural framework (Cronqvist and Hilgert, 2017).

To this end, we welcome contributions centered around **three main research areas**:
